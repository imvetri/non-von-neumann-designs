# non-von-neumann-designs
A collection of computer architecture that are non von neumann 

Kid jumps to bios and turns on "boot from usb" option and saves it. Takes the pendrive and plugs it in.
 Presses and holds the power button. The computer shuts down.


Presses the power button. The computer loads the bootstrap program from the pendrive. Sees a blinking light at the center of the screen


The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack on the connected hardware. It builds a visual model within the blinking light.

Voice: it's not that simple. Do you really know anything that you are talking about?

The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack and builds a knowledge graph.


Voice: Boy calm down. 

The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack and builds an AI model.


Voice: oh AI. It will learn as it gets fed with more data. Go on.


The bootstrap program hits all hardware, collects changes and the dark neural fluid starts to learn.


Voice: you don't know nothing about AI. That's not how it works.


The bootstrap program hits all hardware with instruction set, collects the changes data, feeds it to the dark neural around the blinking light that starts to take a shape. The shape is visible only when you so the screen using mouse towards the blinking light. The blinking light is relevant to the frequency of the CPU.


Voice: Really? Do you think the technology world is there yet? Do you think the monitor can reflect or make the light blink at the rate of the CPU frequency?


*Silence*



Voice: damnit. You are mapping the CPU frequency to the blinking light somehow. But how.
