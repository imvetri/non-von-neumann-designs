# non-von-neumann-designs
A collection of computer architecture that are non von neumann. No..it's not. This is a screenplay.

Kid jumps to bios and turns on "boot from usb" option and saves it. Takes the pendrive and plugs it in.
 Presses and holds the power button. The computer shuts down.


Presses the power button. The computer loads the bootstrap program from the pendrive. Sees a blinking light at the center of the screen


The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack on the connected hardware. It builds a visual model within the blinking light.

"Voice*: it's not that simple. Do you really know anything that you are talking about?

The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack and builds a knowledge graph.


*Voice*: Boy calm down. 

The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack and builds an AI model.


*Voice*: oh AI. It will learn as it gets fed with more data. Go on.


The bootstrap program hits all hardware, collects changes and the dark neural fluid starts to learn.


*Voice*: you don't know nothing about AI. That's not how it works.


The bootstrap program hits all hardware with instruction set, notices how it changes the behaviour of the hardware, learns from the changes and feeds it to the dark neural around the blinking light that starts to take a shape. The shape is visible only when you so the screen using mouse towards the blinking light. The blinking light is relevant to the frequency of the CPU.


*Voice*: Really? Do you think the technology world is there yet? Do you think the monitor can reflect or make the light blink at the rate of the CPU frequency?


*Silence*



*Voice*: damnit. You are mapping the CPU frequency to the blinking light somehow. But how.



Scene two


Kid jumps to bios and turns on "boot from usb" option and saves it. Takes the pendrive and plugs it in.
 Presses and holds the power button. The computer shuts down.


Presses the power button. The computer loads the bootstrap program from the pendrive. Sees a blinking light at the center of the screen


The bootstrap program does a brute force instruction attack on the connected hardware. It builds a visual model within the blinking light.


The kid disappointed with the new toy, has trantum on keyboard. After a while notices the blinking light, blinks dirrentently now.


The kid moves the mouse.

Nothing happens.

The kid scrolls towards and outwards.


The magic happens. There is something happening whenever a keyboard interrupt occurs. Something is starting to make sense to this kid.


The kid understands the machine and learns it's language. The kid has learnt to communicate with the neural os. Goes to sleep with a happy feeling.


Shows up in school, talks about how to build the right software for a computer. With friends. The kid is preparing for the laboratory visit that is scheduled as the last class of the day.


All the students are asked to remove shoes before entering the lab


The kid enters the cold room. Squats with rest of the students waiting for his turn to see the program.


The kid was asked to execute the program and sees a triangle on screen within a window that got launched from a start menu. Goes back to his friend and says everything.

The kid is disappointed from the program he received in the pen drive.


Doesn't talk to anyone, but remains silence and continues with the school routine.


Decades later, shares the fantasy story.
